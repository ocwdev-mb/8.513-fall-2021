## Term Paper

The term paper should be about four pages long. It may be a short review article or a short article about a problem you worked on. The goal is to tell a story, such as an experimental phenomenon, a theoretical framework, etc. Some possible term paper topics:

1. Magnetic orders and their spin waves
2. Boltzmann transport equation for bands with Berry curvature
3. Chern insulators (IQH states) and edge states
4. Graphene and Dirac fermions (and how to gap them)
5. Bilayer graphene and its band structure
6. Weyl semimetals
7. Fractional quantum Hall states
8. Conformal field theories
9. Haldane phase (or AKLT state) of the spin-1 chain
10. Topological superconductors and Majorana zero modes
11. Quantum critical point and critical exponents
12. Or any other topic in condensed matter physics
